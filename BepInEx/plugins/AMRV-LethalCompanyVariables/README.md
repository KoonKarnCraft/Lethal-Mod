This mod allows the user (you) to modify the game with some options.

There are still plenty of configurations im planning to add in the future.

The list of options you can modify:

-   ### **Enemy spawn multiplier**

    Modifies the amount of enemies that spawns each in-game hour  
    _Keep in mind that there are two other limit for the amount of enemies that can be spawned, those are **Enemy power level** and **Enemy cap**_  
    **WARNING** (This configuration does not affect the spawn of turrets or landmines)

-   ### **Enemy power multiplier**:

    Modifies the maximum of total enemies that can be spawned on the level, both inside and outside enemies are affected.  
    _There is still an **individual cap** for evey enemy_

-   ### **Enemy cap multiplier**:

    Modifies the maximum amount of each individual enemy.
    _For example there is a maximum of 5 coil-heads in the level, now you can modify that!_

-   ### **Starting money**:

    Allows you to customize the amount of money you start the game with

-   ### **Deadline days**:

    Changes the amount of days you have to fulfill the quota

-   ### **Hide weather**:

    Hides the level weather and replaces it with an _(Unknown)_ mark  
    **WARNING** This configuration is client-sided, all the players need to install the mod for this configuration to work on them, otherwise you will be the only one who does not know the weather

-   ### **Scrap amount multiplier**:

    Multiplies how much scrap will spawn on the level  
    _(Does not change the amount of beehives)_

-   ### **Scrap price multiplier**:

    Changes the value of the scrap. This works for every kind of scrap, even items such as Keys and the Apparatus

-   ### **Player death penalty**:

    Changes the percent of credits that you lose for each individual death (setting it to 100% will clear all your money, even if just **one** player dies and their body is not recovered)

-   ### **Ship door power**:

    Modifies how long can the ship door remain closed.  
    Greater values mean the door will remain closed for a longer time before overheating, thus automatically opening.

-   ### **Disable ship item limit**:

    Disables the default limit of items inside the ship.

-   ### **Disable signal translator limit**:

    Disables the default limit of 10 characters that the signal translator has.  
    _DISCLAIMER_: Does not change the limit of the terminal input (a config for that will be added in future releases)

-   ### **Enemy spawn probability multiplier**
    Allow to modify the chances of every single enemy in the game to spawn.  
    This configuration is dynamically generated for each registered enemy type so if other mods implement their enemies correctly, they will also work with this configuration.

This mod makes use of my other mod [ConfigurableCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AMRV/ConfigurableCompany/). If you are a modder, you might want to look at it ;)

### Additional info

Some of these configurations have not been fully tested in multiplier, even after checking for the syncronization of values and stuff, there is a chance for any bug to happen. due to the fact that I have no issue page nor there is for thunderstore I suggest you contact me directly to discord [**the_ansuz**]
