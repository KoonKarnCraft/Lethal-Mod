## 1.0.8
cleaned up fingers glitching out on some animations

made dances loop forever and player goes back to idle animation when non-looping emotes are over

yet again improved custom emote creation workflow

added 3 MoreEmotes emotes as placeholders in the 3 previously empty slots 9 - 11 until MoreEmotes compatibility is added

## 1.0.7
added 3 empty animations slots for more custom animations to be added

improved internal custom animation assetbundle building process to be more intuitive

## 1.0.6
added InputUtils dependency
