# KNOW ISSUES!!
- Using the hook to cross pits will send you straight to hell.
- Some areas inside factory will stuck you for a few seconds.

# Changelog
- V 1.0.0 Posted
- V 1.1.1 Added pull function for the HookGun, probably fixed the shoot failing bug and added price configuration
- V 1.3.2 Added additional configurations for the mod, including cooldown and energy cost settings. The hook tip now functions as a visual cooldown tracker. Adjusted the gun position slightly for a better fit in hand.
- V 1.3.4 Hoping for a fix to the random damage caused by using the grappling hook.
